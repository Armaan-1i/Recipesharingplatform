🍽️ RecipeWorld — Your Personal Recipe Sharing Hub

RecipeWorld is a clean, modern, and intuitive recipe-sharing platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is completely frontend-based, meaning everything runs in your browser without the need for a backend server. All recipes are stored using the browser’s LocalStorage, making the platform fast, lightweight, and privacy-friendly.

✨ Key Highlights:
The website offers a beautiful hero section, a responsive recipe grid, and a smooth dark/light mode 🌙 that remembers your preference automatically. Users can browse popular dishes, search recipes by name or ingredients 🔍, and filter them based on categories like Veg, Non-Veg, or Dessert. Each recipe opens in a dedicated details page 📄, dynamically filled with ingredients and step-by-step instructions.

Adding a recipe is effortless — users can enter the title, upload an image link, choose a category, list ingredients, and write cooking steps. All saved recipes appear instantly and remain available even after reloading, thanks to LocalStorage. RecipeWorld also supports exporting all recipes as a JSON file 📤 and importing them later 📥, making it easy to back up or transfer your collection.

This project is ideal for showcasing frontend skills, including DOM manipulation, data handling, clean UI design, and client-side storage. To run the project, simply download or clone the repository, keep the html, css, and js folders together, and open html/index.html in any browser. RecipeWorld is a polished, responsive, and efficient mini-application — perfect for portfolios, learning, or demonstrating practical JavaScript abilities.
